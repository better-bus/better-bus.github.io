# 🚌 BetterBus

BetterBus is a client-only web app designed to help school bus drivers care for their riders with clarity, compassion, and confidence. While route coordinators have dashboards and tools, drivers are often handed a couple of papers and expected to manage a living, breathing community of children. BetterBus offers something more — a way to see, know, and serve each student with dignity.

## ✨ Why BetterBus Exists

BetterBus was born from a simple, sacred desire: to help bus drivers care for their riders.

- **Seating charts** help drivers make thoughtful decisions about where students sit — not just for logistics, but for comfort, safety, and harmony.
- **Roster views** reveal patterns and relationships across the ride, giving drivers a holistic understanding of their bus.
- **Checklists** help drivers learn every name and every seat — because knowing a child’s name is the first step toward caring for them personally.

BetterBus exists to bring help to the drivers and enable them to be more compassionate, and help each student — each child — have a more comfortable and safe ride every day.
